# SHiELD Build System

The scripts contained herein can be used to build GFDL's SHiELD and FV3 Solo models.

# What files are what

The top level directory structure groups source code and input files as follow:

| File/directory       | Purpose |
| --------------       | ------- |
| ```LICENSE.md```     | copy of the Gnu Lesser General Public license, version 3 |
| ```README.md```      | this file with basic pointers to more information |
| ```CHECKOUT_code```  | script to download necessary source for proper build GFDL's SHield and FV3 Solo models <sup>*</sup>|
| ```Build/```         | contains scripts used for building models listed above |
| ```mkmf/```          | submodule entry point for the externally managed [mkmf software](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/mkmf) |
| ```RTS/```           | contains scripts for use in CI software regression testing (see [RTS/README.md](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/SHiELD_build/blob/main/RTS/README.md))|
| ```site/```          | contains site specific scripts and compiler make templates |

<sup>*</sup>By default, ```CHECKOUT_code``` checks out the latest main branch from each repository, which may include experimental features

# Compiling

Be sure to download the mkmf submodule prior to beginning.  To use:

 1) Checkout code via CHECKOUT_code script
    - ./CHECKOUT_code will checkout necessary files for shield
    - ./CHECKOUT_code will automatically run ./CHECKOUT_mom6 for mom6/sis2 files for the coupled version

 2) cd Build and execute ./COMPILE script with the --help option to see usage

 3) COMPILE:
    - ./COMPILE shield: will compile shield with full coupler (utilizing null modules for ocean, land, ice)
    - ./COMPILE shiemom:    will compile mom6, sis2, fv3, gfs as libraries and link them to the full coupler (no null ocean and ice modules.)

      Example: ./COMPILE shield nh repro 32bit intel

For instructions on transitioning or running SHiELD with the FMS full coupler infrastructure, please refer to the documentation and resources available at [doi.org/10.25923/ezfm-az21](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/66759)
